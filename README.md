If you don't have installed TensorFlow, you can run the following command

pip install --upgrade tensorflow

### Usage
The main file is Main_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb, which contains the original model, the results, and the conclusions. Others similarly called files are different alternative models (such as 1venture_funding_with_deep_learning_Alternative.ipynb, 2venture_funding_with_deep_learning_Alternative.ipynb and so on).

Results and comparisons are displayed in the main file as well.

These are jupyter notebooks with a pre-run code. You can go through it and see code as well as results.
